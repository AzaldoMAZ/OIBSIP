## SQL Injection Exploit and Remediation – DVWA

### **1. Exploiting the Vulnerability**

**Target:**  
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) – SQL Injection module (Low security level)

**Steps Taken:**
1. Navigated to the SQL Injection page in DVWA.
2. In the “User ID” field, entered the following payload:
   ```
   1' OR '1'='1
   ```
3. Clicked **Submit**.

**Result:**  
Instead of returning a single user, the application displayed all users in the database. This demonstrates a classic SQL Injection vulnerability, where unsanitized user input is directly included in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query logic.

---

### **2. Why This Works**

The application likely uses code similar to:
```php
$id = $_GET['id'];
$query = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = '$id'";
```
When the input is `1' OR '1'='1`, the query becomes:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = '1' OR '1'='1'
```
Since `'1'='1'` is always true, all users are returned.

---

### **3. How to Patch the Vulnerability**

**A. Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries):**
Prepared statements ensure user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command.

**Example in PHP (MySQLi):**
```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("i", $id);
$stmt->execute();
```
- The `?` is a placeholder, and `bind_param` safely inserts the user’s input.

**B. Additional Best Practices:**
- Validate and sanitize all user input.
- Use least-privilege database accounts.
- Keep software and libraries up to date.

---

### **4. Summary**

- **Exploit:** SQL Injection allowed retrieval of all users by manipulating the query logic.
- **Remediation:** Use prepared statements and input validation to prevent SQL Injection.

# Wireshark Network Traffic Capture Report

## Overview
This document details the process and findings from capturing and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark. The accompanying file, `wireshark_capture.pcap`, contains the recorded network traffic for review and analysis.

## Methodology

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Wireshark Installation:**  
  Downloaded and installed the latest version of Wireshark from the official website ([wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/)).
- **Npcap Installation:**  
  Approved the installation of Npcap during setup to enable packet capturing on Windows.

### 2. Traffic Capture Procedure
- Launched Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi network interface for monitoring.
- Initiated packet capture by clicking the “Start Capturing Packets” (shark fin) button.
- Generated network activity by browsing various websites to ensure a representative sample of traffic.
- Stopped the capture after several minutes by clicking the “Stop” (red square) button.

### 3. Traffic Filtering and Analysis
- **HTTP Filter:**  
  Applied the `http` display filter to search for unencrypted web traffic.  
  *Result:* No HTTP packets were observed, indicating that all web traffic was encrypted.
- **TLS Filter:**  
  Applied the `tls` display filter to isolate encrypted HTTPS traffic.  
  *Result:* Numerous TLS packets were identified, representing secure communications between the local machine and external servers.
- Inspected individual TLS packets to review metadata such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, and details of the TLS handshake process.

### 4. Saving the Capture
- Exported the captured data to a file named `wireshark_capture.pcap` for documentation and further analysis.

## Findings

- **Encrypted Traffic (TLS/HTTPS):**  
  The vast majority of captured packets were encrypted using the TLS protocol, reflecting current best practices for web security. While the content of these packets is not human-readable, metadata such as endpoints and session establishment details are visible.
- **Absence of Unencrypted HTTP:**  
  No unencrypted HTTP traffic was detected during the capture session, confirming that modern websites and services default to secure communication channels.

## How to Review the Capture

1. Open Wireshark.
2. Load the file `wireshark_capture.pcap`.
3. Use the display filter `tls` to view encrypted web traffic.
4. Click on individual packets to examine protocol details, endpoints, and handshake information.

## Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates the prevalence of encrypted web traffic in modern networks. Wireshark is an effective tool for capturing and analyzing such traffic, providing valuable insights into network security and communication patterns, even when payload data is protected.

# Network Security Threats Research Report

## Executive Summary

Network security threats continue to evolve in sophistication and impact, posing significant risks to organizations worldwide. The cybersecurity market is expected to grow to $300 billion this year, reflecting the critical importance of understanding and mitigating these threats. This report examines three primary categories of network security threats: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, and spoofing attacks, providing comprehensive analysis of their mechanisms, impacts, and mitigation strategies.

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

### 1.1 Definition and Mechanism

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a network, service, or website by overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate requests. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks amplify this concept by using multiple compromised systems (botnets) to launch coordinated attacks from various sources simultaneously.

### 1.2 How DoS/DDoS Attacks Work

DoS and DDoS attacks operate through several mechanisms:

**Volume-Based Attacks**: These attacks attempt to consume the bandwidth of the target or consume the bandwidth between the target and the internet. Examples include UDP floods and ICMP floods.

**Protocol Attacks**: These exploit weaknesses in server resources by consuming actual server resources or intermediate communication equipment resources. SYN floods are a common example, where attackers send a succession of SYN packets to a target system without completing the handshake process.

**Application Layer Attacks**: These target web applications by overwhelming specific functions or features with seemingly legitimate requests. HTTP floods and Slowloris attacks fall into this category.

### 1.3 Current Trends and Statistics

The threat landscape for DDoS attacks has evolved significantly globally and particularly in South Africa. Cloudflare mitigated 21.3 million DDoS attacks in 2024, representing a 53% increase compared to 2023. In the African context, there was a 30% increase in DDoS attacks in the Middle East and Africa overall during the first half of 2024.

South Africa has emerged as a prime target, with the country recording the highest number of DDoS attacks in the southern African region by a considerable margin. In 2024, South Africa experienced 130,931 DDoS events, though this represented a decrease from the more than 230,000 incidents seen over the first half of 2024. The largest attack in the region peaked at 210.65 Gbps, demonstrating the significant scale of threats facing South African organizations.

Modern attacks are becoming more sophisticated, with multi-vector attacks using up to eight vectors observed in the region. The longest attack peaked at 14 Gbps on May 12, 2024, showcasing the evolving threat landscape where Southern Africa is becoming a more prominent target for cybercriminals.

### 1.4 Real-World Examples

**South African Telecommunications Sector**: The telecommunications industry in South Africa has been particularly vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Similar to attacks seen elsewhere in Africa, where the hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan targeted major mobile providers in Uganda (Airtel, MTN, and Uganda Telecom) with DDoS attacks that disrupted core operations, South African telecoms face comparable threats.

**Financial Services Impact**: South African financial institutions have experienced significant increases in cyber attacks. One major bank reported a 400% increase in cyber attacks over a two-year period, with millions of attacks occurring monthly. This surge includes DDoS attacks targeting online banking services and mobile banking applications.

**National Health Laboratory Services**: In June 2024, South Africa's National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) was hit with a ransomware attack during a critical mpox outbreak. While primarily a ransomware incident, it was preceded by reconnaissance activities that included network disruption techniques, highlighting the interconnected nature of modern cyber threats.

**Development Bank of Southern Africa**: The state-owned Development Bank of Southern Africa confirmed an 'Akira' ransomware attack in June 2023, where servers, logfiles, and documents were encrypted. Such attacks often begin with network reconnaissance and may include DDoS components to mask other malicious activities.

### 1.5 Impact of DoS/DDoS Attacks

The impact of DoS/DDoS attacks extends beyond simple service disruption:

- **Financial Losses**: Downtime can result in significant revenue loss, especially for e-commerce platforms

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### 2.1 Definition and Mechanism

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks occur when an attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other. The attacker positions themselves between the victim and the intended destination, creating an illusion of direct communication while actually controlling the entire conversation.

### 2.2 How MITM Attacks Work

MITM attacks employ various techniques to intercept communications:

**Network-Based Interception**:
- **ARP Spoofing**: Attackers manipulate Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables to redirect traffic through their systems
- **DNS Spoofing**: Malicious modification of DNS responses to redirect users to attacker-controlled servers
- **Wi-Fi Eavesdropping**: Setting up rogue access points or compromising existing wireless networks

**Application-Layer Attacks**:
- **SSL/TLS Stripping**: Downgrading secure HTTPS connections to unencrypted HTTP
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies or tokens to impersonate legitimate users
- **Certificate-Based Attacks**: Using fraudulent or compromised SSL certificates

### 2.3 Current Attack Vectors

Attackers use techniques such as DNS or ARP spoofing, Wi-Fi eavesdropping, SSL/TLS stripping, and session hijacking to exploit network vulnerabilities. The sophistication of these attacks has increased, with attackers leveraging multiple vectors simultaneously to increase success rates.

### 2.4 Real-World Examples and Case Studies

**South African Banking Sector**: South African financial institutions face sophisticated MITM attacks targeting online banking sessions. Attackers have developed techniques to intercept communications between customers and banks, with one documented case showing hackers using around 20 emulators to spoof more than 16,000 phones belonging to customers with compromised accounts. By entering usernames and passwords through these emulators, hackers initiated fraudulent money orders and siphoned money from mobile accounts.

**Corporate Network Infiltration in SA**: South African companies have experienced Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks where MITM techniques are used for lateral movement within corporate networks. The South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) has been repeatedly targeted, with hackers infiltrating their IT infrastructure in 2023 and again in April 2024, demonstrating persistent MITM-style attacks.

**TransUnion South Africa Data Breach**: In March 2022, the South African branch of TransUnion credit organization lost 4 terabytes of customer data, putting millions of clients at risk of identity theft. The attack involved sophisticated MITM techniques to intercept and exfiltrate sensitive customer information, accompanied by a $15 million ransom demand.

**Public Wi-Fi Attacks in Major Cities**: Attackers commonly set up fake Wi-Fi hotspots in public locations across Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, including coffee shops, airports, and hotels. Unsuspecting users connect to these networks, allowing attackers to intercept all communications, particularly targeting business travelers and tourists.

## 3. Spoofing Attacks

### 3.1 Definition and Types

Spoofing attacks involve the creation of false identities or the impersonation of legitimate entities to deceive targets into revealing sensitive information or performing unauthorized actions. These attacks can target various layers of network communications and take multiple forms.

### 3.2 Common Types of Spoofing Attacks

**IP Spoofing**: Attackers forge IP packet headers to disguise their identity or impersonate another system. This technique is often used in DDoS attacks to hide the true source of the attack.

**ARP Spoofing**: ARP spoofing can be used to carry out man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker can manipulate or steal sensitive information. Attackers send falsified ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another device.

**DNS Spoofing**: DNS spoofing can be used for a MITM attack in which a victim inadvertently sends sensitive information to a malicious host. Attackers corrupt DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites.

**Email Spoofing**: Forging email headers to make messages appear as if they come from trusted sources, commonly used in phishing attacks.

**Caller ID Spoofing**: Manipulating phone system identifiers to display false caller information.

### 3.3 How Spoofing Attacks Work

Spoofing attacks typically follow these patterns:

**Identity Falsification**: The attacker creates or modifies identifiers (IP addresses, MAC addresses, domain names, etc.) to impersonate legitimate entities.

**Trust Exploitation**: The attack leverages the target's trust in the spoofed identity to bypass security measures or social engineering defenses.

**Payload Delivery**: Once trust is established, the attacker can deliver malicious content, steal information, or perform unauthorized actions.

### 3.4 Real-World Examples

**Experian South Africa Data Breach**: One of the most significant spoofing-related incidents in South Africa occurred when Experian, a credit bureau agency, exposed personal information of approximately 24 million South Africans and 800,000 business entities to a suspected fraudster. The attack involved sophisticated identity spoofing techniques where the attacker masqueraded as a legitimate client to gain access to sensitive data.

**South African Banking Phishing Campaigns**: Attackers regularly spoof the identities of major South African banks including Standard Bank, FNB, ABSA, and Nedbank to conduct phishing campaigns. These attacks involve email spoofing where criminals send messages that appear to come from trusted financial institutions, targeting customers' banking credentials and personal information.

**Business Email Compromise in SA Corporates**: South African companies have experienced numerous Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks where criminals spoof executive email addresses. In documented cases, attackers have impersonated CEOs and CFOs of Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed companies to trick employees into transferring funds or revealing sensitive information.

**Telecommunications Fraud**: South African telecommunications companies have reported significant increases in caller ID spoofing attacks, where criminals manipulate phone system identifiers to appear as legitimate service providers or government agencies, particularly targeting elderly customers and small businesses.

**DNS Spoofing Attacks on SA Organizations**: Several South African organizations have fallen victim to DNS spoofing attacks where attackers corrupt DNS responses to redirect users to malicious websites. These attacks have particularly targeted online banking customers and e-commerce platforms, with criminals creating convincing replicas of legitimate South African business websites.

### 3.5 Impact of Spoofing Attacks

Spoofing attacks can have wide-ranging consequences:

- **Financial Fraud**: Direct monetary losses through fraudulent transactions or wire transfers

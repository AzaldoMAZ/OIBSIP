## Network Security Threat Landscape

### Global Context

The global cybersecurity landscape has experienced unprecedented growth in both attack volume and sophistication. Cloudflare mitigated 21.3 million DDoS attacks in 2024, representing a 53% increase compared to 2023. This growth reflects the increasing digitization of business operations and the corresponding expansion of attack surfaces.

### South African Threat Environment

South Africa faces unique cybersecurity challenges within the continental and global context. The country has become a prime target for cybercriminals, experiencing the highest number of DDoS attacks in the southern African region. Key factors contributing to this targeting include:

- **Economic Significance:** As Africa's most developed economy, South Africa presents attractive targets for financially motivated attackers
- **Digital Infrastructure:** Advanced telecommunications and financial services infrastructure provide multiple attack vectors
- **Regulatory Environment:** Evolving cybersecurity regulations create compliance pressures that attackers may exploit
- **Skills Gap:** A significant shortage of cybersecurity professionals affects organizational defense capabilities

### Attack Vector Evolution

Modern network attacks demonstrate several concerning trends:

- **Multi-Vector Approaches:** Attackers increasingly combine multiple attack types simultaneously
- **AI and Automation:** Machine learning techniques enhance attack efficiency and evasion capabilities

## Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks

### Technical Definition and Mechanisms

Denial of Service attacks aim to make network resources unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming systems with malicious traffic. DDoS attacks amplify this concept by leveraging multiple compromised systems (botnets) to generate coordinated attack traffic from distributed sources.

#### Attack Classifications

**Volume-Based Attacks**
These attacks consume network bandwidth through high-volume traffic floods. Common techniques include:
- **UDP Floods:** Overwhelming targets with User Datagram Protocol packets
- **ICMP Floods:** Flooding targets with Internet Control Message Protocol packets
- **Amplification Attacks:** Exploiting protocols like DNS, NTP, or SNMP to generate large response volumes

**Protocol Attacks**
These attacks exploit weaknesses in network protocols to consume server resources:
- **SYN Floods:** Initiating TCP connections without completing the handshake process
- **Ping of Death:** Sending malformed or oversized packets to crash target systems
- **Smurf Attacks:** Exploiting ICMP and broadcast addressing to amplify attack traffic

**Application Layer Attacks**
These sophisticated attacks target specific application functions:
- **HTTP Floods:** Overwhelming web servers with seemingly legitimate HTTP requests
- **Slowloris Attacks:** Maintaining multiple connections to exhaust server connection pools
- **DNS Query Floods:** Overwhelming DNS servers with excessive query volumes

### Current Threat Landscape in South Africa

South Africa has emerged as a significant target for DDoS attacks within the African continent. In 2024, the country experienced 130,931 DDoS events, representing the highest concentration of attacks in southern Africa. This figure represents a concerning trend, though it shows some decrease from the more than 230,000 incidents recorded in the first half of 2024.

#### Attack Characteristics
- **Peak Attack Size:** The largest recorded attack in the region reached 210.65 Gbps
- **Duration Patterns:** The longest attack peaked at 14 Gbps on May 12, 2024
- **Complexity Trends:** Multi-vector attacks using up to eight different attack vectors have been observed
- **Sector Targeting:** Telecommunications, financial services, and government sectors face the highest attack volumes

### Real-World Impact: South African Case Studies

#### Telecommunications Sector Vulnerabilities

The South African telecommunications industry has experienced significant DDoS-related disruptions. Drawing parallels from regional attacks, such as those conducted by the hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan against major African mobile providers (Airtel, MTN, and Uganda Telecom), South African telecommunications companies face similar threats targeting core operational systems.

These attacks typically:
- Disrupt customer access to mobile and internet services
- Impact billing and customer management systems  
- Affect emergency services that rely on telecommunications infrastructure
- Generate significant revenue losses during service outages

#### Financial Services Under Siege

South African financial institutions report alarming increases in cyber attack volumes. One major bank documented a 400% increase in cyber attacks over a two-year period, with millions of attacks occurring monthly. These attacks specifically target:

- **Online Banking Platforms:** DDoS attacks designed to disrupt customer access during peak usage periods
- **Mobile Banking Applications:** Coordinated attacks that overwhelm mobile app infrastructure
- **Payment Processing Systems:** Attacks timed to coincide with high-value transaction periods
- **Customer Service Systems:** Attacks that prevent customers from reporting fraud or accessing support

#### Critical Infrastructure Impacts

The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) incident in June 2024 demonstrated how DDoS attacks can serve as precursors to more sophisticated attacks. While primarily a ransomware attack occurring during a critical mpox outbreak, the incident was preceded by network reconnaissance and disruption activities that included DDoS components.

Similarly, the Development Bank of Southern Africa's experience with the 'Akira' ransomware attack in June 2023 highlighted how DDoS attacks often serve to mask other malicious activities, including data exfiltration and system infiltration.

### Business Impact Assessment
